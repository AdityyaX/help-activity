msgid "An association between a name which may mean nothing by itself and a description intended to convey an important idea. Frequently we need a different kind of association between names and ideas, such as pictures, animations, or actual experience. The most important purpose of definitions is to explain what the thing named does; another is to describe its uses, or as we often say its purposes; a third is to describe the appearance of something, so that we can recognize it when we see it; a fourth is to enable us to talk about the thing conveniently with those who already have some idea of it. Usually the order of importance of these purposes is entirely misunderstood."
