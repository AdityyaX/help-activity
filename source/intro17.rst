Introduction to XO Help 17
==========================

Welcome to a new look in XO Help 17.

If you are starting with an XO laptop you might jump straight to the top of the "Hardware section" :doc:`/getting_started`.

When you press the "next" link at the top right of this page you will move on to the page, The Sugar User Interface. To a new user this is a somethat theoretical page, but the **following** few pages covering navigation are more new user friendly and important for all new users.

The Activity you are using, Help, has its own :doc:`/help` page. Help will display, the pages in the index, plus (when you are online) pages linked to the internet.

In Help use the "Back" button |Back| to return to the previous page, and the "Home" button |Home| to return to :doc:`/index`

Activities are listed in alphabetical order, starting with :doc:`/browse`.

The section of the table of Contents, Network, starts with the page :doc:`/give_me_the_internet`

In Help pages, the green arrow |more| is used to signify moving to material at a deeper level.

.. Note::

   This is an experimental new page. You can improve it yourself by following :doc:`/how_to_help`.
