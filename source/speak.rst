Using
-----

Speak is a talking face for the XO laptop. Anything you type will be spoken aloud using the XO's speech synthesizer, espeak. Use the toolbars at the top to change the voice's accent, rate and pitch or the shape of the eyes and mouth.

You can ask Alice a question too.

This is a great way to experiment with the speech synthesizer, learn to type or just have fun making a funny face for your XO.

After you've adjusted the settings it looks nicer in full-screen mode (Press Alt-Enter to switch).

Use the Journal to resume your Speak activity including all voice, face and history settings.
