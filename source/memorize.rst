About
-----

This Activity allows learners to take the learning process in their own hands, as they play but also create their own games. The game has matching pairs of what are clickable tiles, or blocks. The card pairs are composed of text, sound or images. The children turn over the cards to match words, words and sounds, words and pictures, or pictures and sounds. There are a few default games loaded. These images, sounds and text can be extended to animations or movie snippets. Players of Memorize can play together across multiple machines.

How to play
:::::::::::

When you click "Load demo games" and select 'addition' from the pull-down menu, you will get a grid of 16 squares. Each square in the top two rows will be marked with the number 1; the squares in the bottom two rows will each have the number 2. 

Each square in the top row hides a simple addition problem which you can view by clicking on it. The answer to the addition problem is hidden under one of the squares in the bottom two rows. There is no way to know under which square, you must simply guess. Move the cursor down to your selected guess, and notice that the bottom two rows are now 'live'--each square is highlighted as you cross it.
