"If you want to write a letter to the editor, you first need to look in the "
"newspaper or on the paper's web site to find their e-mail address for "
"letters. Some newspapers have a policy of publishing all appropriate letters "
"sent to the editor, but most are more selective. All require you to include "
"your complete name, address, and a contact telephone number. You can, "
"however, request that your letter be published with \"name withheld\" if you "
"want. Most editors call you to verify that you really did write the letter "
"before printing it. They also reserve the right to edit your letter to fit "
"the available space on the page."
