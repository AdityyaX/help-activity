"The user interface differs from the traditional Desktop metaphor. It uses a "
"\"zooming\" metaphorâ€”each view represents a different scale of interaction. "
"You move between a view of the network \"neighborhood\", your \"friends\", "
"your \"home page\", and your currently open application (\"Activity\"). Each "
"view occupies the entire screen. There are no overlapping windows to deal "
"with."

"Sugar supports sharing and collaboration by default. Sugar brings many of "
"the rich collaboration mechanisms we are accustomed to from the Internet "
"directly into the user interface. Sharing a file, starting a chat, "

"never more than a single click away."

"Sugar emphasizes discovery.  Every object in the interface has a menu that "
"reveals more details and options for action. Many Activities include a "
"\"view source\" option; for example, the Browse activity lets you examine "
"the HTML code that reveals how a web page is created. Most Activities are "
"written in the Python scripting language.  You can see how they work, and "
"make changes to them."

"Sugar does not have applications in the traditional sense. Activities are "
"distinct from applications in what they focus on (collaboration and "
"expression) and in their implementation (journaling and iteration). This is "

"learning experience we hope the children will have when using Sugar."

"Everyone has the potential for learning and teaching. Sugar puts "
"collaboration at the core of the user experience in order to realize this "
"potential. The presence of other learners encourages children to take "
"responsibility for others' learning as well as their own. The exchange of "
"ideas amongst peers makes the learning process more engaging and stimulates "
"critical thinking skills. Sugar encourages these types of social interaction "
"with the laptops."

"Sugar emphasizes thinking, expressing, and communicating using technology. "
"Sugar starts from the premise that we want to use what people already know "
"in order to make connections to new knowledge. Computation is a \"thing to "
"think with\". Sugar makes the primary activity of the children one of "
"creative expression, in whatever form that might take. Most activities focus "
"on the creation of some type of object, be it a drawing, a song, a story, a "
"game, or a program. In another language shift describing the user "
"experience, we refer to objects rather than files as the primary stuff of "
"creative expression."

"As most software developers would agree, the best way to learn how to write "
"a program is to write one, or perhaps teach someone else how to do so. "
"Studying the syntax of the language is useful, but it doesn't teach one how "
"to code. We apply the principle of \"learning through doing\" to all types "
"of creation. For example, we emphasize composing music over downloading "
"music. We also encourage the children to engage in the process of "
"collaborative critique of their expressions and to iterate upon this "
"expression as well."

"Turning the traditional file system into objects speaks more directly to "

"The concept of the Journal, a written documentation of everyday events, is "
"generally understood, albeit in various forms across cultures. A journal "
"typically chronicles the Activities one has done throughout the day. We have "
"adopted a journal metaphor for the file system as our approach to file "
"organization. The underlying implementation of the journal does not differ "
"significantly from file systems in contemporary operating systems.  The file "
"system layout is less important than the journal itself."

"The Journal stores objects created while the student runs an Activity. This "
"function is secondary, although important. The Journal naturally lends "
"itself to a chronological organization.  Objects in the Journal can be "
"tagged, searched, and sorted by a variety of means.  The Journal records "
"what a child has done, not just what the child has saved. The Journal is a "
"portfolio or scrapbook history of the child's interactions with the machine "
"and also with peers."

"The Journal includes entries explicitly created by the children with entries "
"that are implicitly created through the child's participation in an "
"Activities.  Developers must think carefully about how an activity "
"integrates with the Journal more so than with a traditional file system that "
"functions independently of an application. The Activities, the objects, and "
"the means of recording all tightly integrate to create a different kind of "
"computer experience."
