"An association between a name which may mean nothing by itself and a "
"description intended to convey an important idea. Frequently we need a "
"different kind of association between names and ideas, such as pictures, "
"animations, or actual experience. The most important purpose of definitions "
"is to explain what the thing named does; another is to describe its uses, or "
"as we often say its purposes; a third is to describe the appearance of "
"something, so that we can recognize it when we see it; a fourth is to enable "
"us to talk about the thing conveniently with those who already have some "
"idea of it. Usually the order of importance of these purposes is entirely "
"misunderstood."
